COMMON SENSE COMPENDIUM
Based on ideas inspired by Yann LeCun’s arguments about implicit knowledge.

PART I: THE PHYSICAL WORLD

Objects exist continuously in space and time. They do not appear or disappear without cause. 
A solid object cannot occupy the same space as another solid object. If two solid objects collide, they resist interpenetration. 
Objects fall toward the ground if unsupported. Gravity pulls objects downward unless something holds them up. 
Heavier objects are harder to lift. Lighter objects are easier to move. 
Fragile objects can break if dropped or hit with force. 
Sharp objects can cut or pierce softer materials. 
Hot things can burn skin. Cold things can freeze or stiffen materials. 
Liquids flow and take the shape of their containers. Gases expand to fill available space. 
Fire consumes fuel and produces heat and light. 
Smoke usually rises because it is made of hot air and particles. 

Time moves forward. Events happen in sequence. The past cannot be changed. The future can be influenced by present actions. 
When something is moved, it changes location. When it stops moving, it stays where it is unless acted upon again. 
Friction slows down moving objects that touch surfaces. 
If something is pushed, it tends to move in the direction of the push. 
If something is pulled, it moves toward the pull. 
Energy can be stored, transferred, and used to make things happen.

PART II: THE LIVING WORLD

Living things grow, consume energy, and can reproduce. 
Plants need sunlight, water, and nutrients from soil to live. 
Animals need food, water, and air to survive. 
Humans are animals with complex social behavior and advanced reasoning. 
People get tired and must rest. Sleep restores energy. 
If someone doesn’t eat or drink for a long time, they become weak and can die. 
Humans can feel pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst, and fear. 
People usually avoid pain and seek comfort and safety. 
Illness can make people weak or unable to work. 
Health improves with proper food, rest, and hygiene. 

Children depend on adults for care and learning. 
Adults protect and teach younger people. 
Old age can bring weakness or forgetfulness. 
Death is irreversible. Living things that die do not come back. 

Animals react to threats by running away or fighting. 
Predators eat prey. Prey avoid predators. 
Domesticated animals often rely on humans for food and shelter.

PART III: THE SOCIAL WORLD

Humans are social creatures. They live in groups, families, and communities. 
Communication helps people cooperate and share goals. 
Spoken language, writing, and gestures convey information and emotion. 
Politeness helps maintain harmony in groups. 
Rudeness or aggression can cause conflict. 
People trust others who behave consistently and keep promises. 
Breaking a promise damages trust. 
Apologies can repair social relationships. 

People often help each other when cooperation benefits everyone. 
Sharing food or information can strengthen bonds. 
Greed or selfishness can cause resentment. 
Leadership arises when some people guide others toward common goals. 
Rules and laws reduce conflict by setting shared expectations. 
Justice means fair treatment and accountability. 
Lies can protect or harm others, depending on intent. 
Telling the truth builds long-term trust. 

Emotions guide behavior. Happiness signals satisfaction. Anger signals frustration or threat. 
Fear helps avoid danger. Sadness often follows loss. 
Empathy helps one understand how others feel. 
Kindness and generosity make social life smoother and safer.

PART IV: THE COGNITIVE WORLD

Humans learn by observing, experimenting, and remembering. 
Mistakes teach lessons that improve future behavior. 
Attention focuses thought on relevant details. 
Distraction reduces performance. 
People forget things over time, especially details that seem unimportant. 
Language allows thought to be shared and refined. 
Memory is fallible; people sometimes misremember or confuse events. 

People can plan by imagining future outcomes and choosing actions that lead toward goals. 
Curiosity drives exploration and discovery. 
Understanding cause and effect helps predict outcomes. 
People infer hidden causes from patterns they see. 
Coincidence does not always mean causation. 

Beliefs shape perception. Expectations influence how experiences are interpreted. 
Strong emotions can bias judgment. 
People often simplify complex information to make quick decisions. 
Overconfidence can lead to mistakes.

PART V: THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT

Humans create tools to extend their abilities. 
A hammer amplifies the force of a hand strike. A knife cuts better than fingernails. 
Machines use energy to perform tasks repeatedly or with more power than humans alone. 
Electricity powers lights, computers, and many household tools. 
Vehicles transport people and goods faster than walking. 
Roads, bridges, and buildings form infrastructure that enables cities to function. 
Shelter protects from rain, heat, and cold. 
Clothing protects the body and signals identity. 

Money serves as a common measure of value and medium of exchange. 
Work provides income and purpose. 
Time is often divided into schedules and routines. 
People rest on weekends or holidays to recover from effort. 

Technology evolves through cumulative innovation. 
Each generation inherits tools and knowledge from the past. 
New inventions solve problems but may also create new risks. 
Complex systems require maintenance. Neglect leads to breakdown.

PART VI: META-REASONING AND HUMAN NATURE

Humans try to understand the world by forming mental models. 
Models are simplified representations of reality that allow prediction and reasoning. 
A model that predicts well is useful even if incomplete. 
Experience updates models over time. 
Learning never ends because the world changes. 

Curiosity, play, and experimentation are natural learning strategies. 
Children learn by imitation and trial and error. 
Feedback strengthens good habits and discourages harmful ones. 
People can teach others, transmitting knowledge beyond direct experience. 
Cultural memory accumulates across generations. 

Common sense is the ability to use experience and background knowledge to judge what is reasonable or likely. 
It allows humans to fill gaps in incomplete information. 
It is rarely written because it feels obvious to those who share it. 
Machines trained only on text may miss much of this implicit structure. 

To achieve human-like understanding, a system must model the world itself — not only the words people use to describe it. 
Perception, prediction, and action create grounded meaning. 
Embodied learning connects symbols to real causes and effects. 
Without grounding, words are only shadows of experience. 

Human wisdom comes from integrating perception, memory, emotion, and reasoning. 
Language reflects understanding but does not replace it. 
Common sense is the invisible framework that makes communication possible. 
It lives in every human mind, shaped by a lifetime of experience with the physical and social world. 
Recording it explicitly, as done here, makes visible what usually remains implicit.
